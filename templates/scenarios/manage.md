# Manage <<Token-Name>>

The [Manage methodology](../../manage/index.md) in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure outlines a path for implementing an operations baseline, and maturing that baseline throughout your cloud adoption lifecycle.

Describe how your scenario changes operations management

## <<Token-Name>> business alignment

Does this scenario require the customer to rethink business alignment or how the platform is supported in operations management?

## <<Token-Name>> operations baseline

Does this workload have special requirements for Visibility, Operational Compliance, or BCDR?

## <<Token-Name>> platform operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the landing zone or platform for this scenario?

## <<Token-Name>> workload operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the individual workloads running on this platform?

## Next step: Your next migration iteration

Once the <<Token-Name>> migration is complete, the cloud adoption team can begin your next scenario-specific migration. Alternatively, if there are addition platforms to be migrated, this article series can be used again to guide your next <<Token-Name>> migration or deployment.
