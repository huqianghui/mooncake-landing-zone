# Template for new tech platform scenarios

The files in this folder are designed to start a new tech platform scenario with minimum necessary requirements in place.

## CAF work to finalize the scenarios

- For each ESLZ page, the headers & metadata need to look more like the corresponding file in the AKS scenario
- CAF team to review the articles & identify any additional requirements for each page
- CAF team to review the articles for quality to ensure we don't start with known errors
- CAF team to update the Ready article to match AKS scenario flow

## ThinkTank team steps to use this template

1. All scenario articles (not prefixed with `eslz-`) must accurately reflect the CAF methodologies **and** the marketing motion to drive this scenario. Each starts with a series of sections that must be evaluated & populated based on CAF links in each section.
1. Add as many H2 sections after the core CAF sections as required to tell the story & guide adoption.
1. Codename: *Construction sets* are often at a different scope than the parent scenario. The name of those assets will likely match a hero technology, instead of the business problem reflected in the scenario name.
1. Update the `enterprise-scale-landing-zone.md` file to reflect the demonstrated architecture & link to the actionable deployment.
1. Populate all remaining ESLZ articles (prefixed with `eslz-`) to reflect any considerations or recommendations required to prepare for the ESLZ deployment. Any additional guidance may be added after the H2's for recommendations & considerations.
